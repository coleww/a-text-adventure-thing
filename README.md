# A-dungeon-client

hyper-"text based" adventure game

CURRENT GOAL:

- navigate through some rooms,
- find a key,
- use it to open a door and get to a new area.

FUTURE:

- some sort of persistent session object thing to store user health, inventory, etc.
- server will eventually bear responsibility of ensuring user only GET's rooms they can access.
- server might also do some of the magic (like trying to enter a room w/o the key gives you a 401)
